# Maze Agent Simulation

## Description
This Python project simulates an agent navigating through a maze, implementing path planning algorithms and sensor simulation. The agent is tasked with finding its way through the maze while using simulated sensors to perceive its environment and make decisions accordingly.

## Features
- **Maze Generation:** Utilizes maze generation algorithms to create different maze layouts for the agent to navigate.
- **Path Planning:** Implements various path planning algorithms such as A* search, Dijkstra's algorithm, or Q-learning to guide the agent through the maze.
- **Sensor Simulation:** Simulates sensors to allow the agent to perceive its surroundings, detect obstacles, and make informed decisions.
- **Visualization:** Provides visualization of the maze, agent movement, and path planning process for easy understanding and analysis.
