# Maze Agent Simulation

## Description
This Python project simulates an agent navigating through a maze, implementing path planning algorithms and sensor simulation. The agent is tasked with finding its way through the maze while using simulated sensors to perceive its environment and make decisions accordingly.

## Features
- **Path Planning:** Implements various path planning algorithms.
- **Sensor Simulation:** Simulates sensors to allow the agent to perceive its surroundings.
- **Visualization:** Provides visualization of the maze, agent movement, and path planning process for easy understanding and analysis.
